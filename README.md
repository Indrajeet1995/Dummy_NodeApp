## A simple NodeJS based 2 tier microservice application, I use it mostly for testing on kubernetes. You can use it to upload notes with images. it also comes with a mongo backend this was originally developed by https://github.com/learnk8s/knote-js. I did some changes to it according to my needs. #

`kubectl apply -f notepadapp.yaml`
`kubectl apply -f mongo.yaml`
